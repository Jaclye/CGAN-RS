# CGAN-RS_model
# The file 5000 Synthetic Data Samples.csv contains data where the first 8 rows represent values at specific period points, and the 9th row corresponds to the error with respect to the design response spectrum.
# The Generator and Discriminator model structures are referenced from the GM-GANO project: https://github.com/yzshi5/GM-GANO/blob/main/Python_libs/GANO_model.py.
